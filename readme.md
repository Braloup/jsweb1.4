# 1.4 - Age calculator

## Functional program except for the day of the month and entries in the table.

Display three select boxes allowing to enter a birthdate. When the user selects a value for each of the select boxes, display its age.

Bonus: Make your components smart by making it impossible to enter a date that doesn't exist. (Like 1990-04-31 or 1991-02-29.)
